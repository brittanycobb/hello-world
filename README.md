# hello-world

I'm Brittany Cobb, an aspiring web developer based in Dallas, Texas. I recently graduated from The University of Texas at Dallas in Spring 2018 with a B.A. in Emerging Media and Communications.

My interests in both digital art and programming led me to web development, a field where my analytical mind and various creative talents serve me well in building and designing web pages and web applications. I love finding ways to challenge myself and build on my knowledge, as learning is a great passion of mine.

I'm an avid reader, a musician, and a cat person.
